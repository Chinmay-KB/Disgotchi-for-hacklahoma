# Disgotchi-for-hacklahoma [![Ditto](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/bank/normal/ditto.png)](http://pokemondb.net/pokedex/ditto)   
Funky tamagotchi discord bot (wow ðŸ˜†!)  

## Gameplay for disgotchi  
* :egg: Hatching Stage:  
Each day in the real world is approx. one year in the tamagotchi "world"  
Whenever the bot appears into the server we want it to send a message that states something like.  
> "An egg appeared in the server"  
    
Whenever the egg hatches (which should take about 5 or so minutes from appearing in the server) we want to prompt the user (owner or admins)
to name the Disgotchi.  
Whenever it hatches we also want to assign it a "personality" type, (violet suggested having different animals, dog, cat, bird, etc).  
This can be random or chosen by the user, can make choice for random.  
This stage can be sort of a setup stage for the Disgotchi.

* :hatched_chick: Growing Stage:   
We can add something to where each day or few days the disgotchi "grows" into a different form of itself like from toddler, to adolescense, to teen, to adult and so on  
The different stages would allow for more interaction with the pet and dialogue (nate can write the script for each dialogue/personality thing)  
Make it to where it would passively say messages every now and then if the user wants it to  
  
**This applies to both growing and adult stage**    
Features to interact with disgotchi:   
* feed/give water to disgotchi    
* play/exercise  
* scold/praise  
* sleep (turn off/on light)  
* clean up poop (in the actual game lol)  
* heal disgotchi if sick (makes it unhappy if you dont)  
* display age, weight(?), discipline, hunger, happiness  
* speak to disgotchi (disgotchi recognizes the words from users to it and responds with emotes)

* :rooster: Adult Stage:  
  
*  :1st_place_medal: Additional Features (As time allows):    
Leaderboards within the server to show who takes care of the Disgotchi the most    
Achievements whenever the server/user reaches a certain benchmark (i.e. the server feeding the pet 1000 times or a single user feeding the pet 100 times)  
Achievements will add a certain XP to the bond value of the pet to make it "act closer" to the servers users
    
* Notes: 
Personality types would change the "behavior" when interacting with the users, different ways to play with the pet and different dialogue options -Nate
