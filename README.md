# Disgotchi-for-hacklahoma 
Funky tamagotchi discord bot (wow ðŸ˜†!)  

## Gameplay for disgotchi  
* Hatching Stage
Each day in the real world is approx. one year in the tamagotchi "world"  
Whenever the bot appears into the server we want it to send a message that states something like.  
> "An egg appeared in the server"  
Whenever the egg hatches (which should take about 5 or so minutes from appearing in the server) we want to prompt the user (owner or admins)
to name the Disgotchi.  
Whenever it hatches we also want to assign it a "personality" type, (violet suggested having different animals, dog, cat, bird, etc).  
This can be random or chosen by the user, can make choice for random.  
This stage can be sort of a setup stage for the Disgotchi.  
* Growing Stage  
* Adult Stage  
  
* Notes: 
Personality types would change the "behavior" when interacting with the users, different ways to play with the pet and different dialogue options
